<p>All questions require a YES response or a selection of Over Ride with comment for the consult to be sent to the consulting service.</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If applicable, take action so that a yes response can be entered.</li>
	<li>If you believe the consult is needed without a Yes, you can change your selection to "Over Ride"</li>
	<li>Reconsider if this consult is currently needed</li>
</ul>

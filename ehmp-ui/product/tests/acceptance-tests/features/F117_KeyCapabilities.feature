Feature: F117 provides cross cutting UI concerns including: displaying the current patient identifying traits, displaying the application version, and providing screen-to-screen navigation.

# POC: Team Mercury
Background:
#	Given user is logged into eHMP-UI
	And user searches for and selects "Ten,Patient"
	Then Cover Sheet is active

@US2145
Scenario: Verify current patient identifying traits, application version and screen to screen navigation
	Then the "patient identifying traits" is displayed with information
		| html 			| value 				|
		| patient name  | Ten,Patient 			|
		# | DOB         	| 04/07/1935 (80y)      |
		| SSN 			| 666-00-0010			|
        | Gender        | Male                  |
    And the patient DOB is in correct format
	And "Bottom Region" contains "eHMP version"
	Then the navigation bar displays the Patient Search Button
	When the user clicks the Patient Search Button
	Then the patient search screen is displayed

Scenario: Stacked Graph is only available in Expanded View
  And user searches for and selects "Eight,Patient"
  Then Overview is active
  And the user clicks the Workspace Manager
  Then the user deletes all user defined workspaces
  Given the user creates a user defined workspace named "stackgraphexpanded"
  When the user customizes the "stackgraphexpanded" workspace
  And the user adds a "stackedGraph" applet to the user defined workspace
  Then the user is presented with an option for "Expanded View"
  And the user is not presented with an option for "Trend View"
  And the user is not presented with an option for "Summary View"

  Then the "RENAMECHECK" screen is active
  And the active screen displays 1 applets
  And the Stacked Graph Expanded applet is displayed
  When the user attempts to rename the "stackedGraph" applet to "RENAME APPLET"
  Then the "stackedGraph" applet is titled "RENAME APPLET"

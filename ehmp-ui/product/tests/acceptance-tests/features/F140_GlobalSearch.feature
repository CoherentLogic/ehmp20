Feature: F140 â€“ All Patient Search

#This feature will allow a user to search for patients globally in eHMP through a global patient search feature MVI.  Once the search criteria is entered, a maximum of 10 results will be shown. If there are more than 10 results, than no results will be returned.  This also searches for sensitive patient.

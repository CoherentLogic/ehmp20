Changes to schema vs. Sept 2011 HL7 DAM, to be also incorporated into Future HL7 DAM:

- FOR FUTURE: Make ClinicalStatementEntityInRoleRelationship and RelatedClinicalStatementToEntityInRole have a relationshipTimeInterval, similar to EntityRelationship.  This is logically desirable and also may simplify implementations by having entities have similar attributes whether they are related to a clinical statement or entity source.
- ALREADY CHANGED: Made bodySiteCode within BodySite attributes optional rather than mandatory.  This change was made because a specific body site may be implied by the type of procedure, problem, etc., such that only the laterality is of interest (e.g., bilateral laterality for a mastectomy).

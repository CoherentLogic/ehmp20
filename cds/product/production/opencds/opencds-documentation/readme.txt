=====================

This folder contains two types of documentation:

1.  Notes and working documents which are not maintained, and may be out of date.
This material will *not* be published with a release version.

2.  The latest reference material designed to be published with the next release
version.  This material is maintained, and should represent the latest available
information.  Every attempt will be made to update these documents for each
release.

1.  We have problems with saves failing

2.  we have problems with the Guvnor tester not able to create certain structures of test data.

3.  we have problems with trying to set values in RHS of facts lists and referencing a variable assigned in the LHS:  workaround is to set RHS before setting LHS.

4.  Archiving everything, and then deleting all archives leaves a bunch of links in the following lists

Browse | Assets | Inbox | Incoming changes 
			|| Recently Opened 
			|| Recently Edited

This does not happen to the following lists:
Browse | Assets | By Status 
		|| By Category 


5.  Nested drop-downs do not work with DSL, but they work in guided rules.
5b.  In guided rules, nested drop-downs work to 3 levels on LHS, but only to 2 levels on RHS.

6. Need to verify that extending class does not lead to unexpected behaviors.

7. Assigning enumeration to a list causes unexpected behavior when populating items in Test.

8. Web decision tables do not support nested dropdowns.

9. In Firefox (at least), text field for free form DRL in Guided rules editor is very small.

10. Admin --> Export function results in needing to log back in (otherwise, error message generated when trying to work on new assets)

11. Guvnor guided editor problem -> once add name to variable, cannot remove it.

12. Guvnor test scenarios --> once defining attributes for Fact type, cannot add new facts of type and have attributes show up for data entry (can't add another instance of fact).

13. Guvnor categories --> must delete contents individually before can get rid of them.  Can't delete entire package and then get rid of categories that reference them.  Probably pointers don't get reset.

14. DSL --> depending on name/relative order, behavior changes.  See Procedure DSLs in extract 2011_03_30b.  Issue seems to be when narrative text in front of first variable is the same.

15. Guvnor test scenarios --> for globals with String attributes, cannot add values for those attributes.

VMR notes from pre-submission total review 12/21/2011 by des

1. Datatypes seem to match perfectly
2. CDSInput seems to match perfectly
3. VMR
	a. EvaluatedPersons as a separate list from Entities seems to not be a notion in the vMR model, but is probably OK
		1.) EvaluatedPerson extends Person in the model, but includes Person elements and extends Entity in the schema.
	b. EvaluatedPersonRelationships as a separate list from Entities seems to not be a notion in the vMR model, but is probably OK
		1.) both of the above elements are actually special cases that are handled differently in schema than in the model.
	c. Entity as a separate class instead of a base class seems to not be in the vMR model
		1.) Entity as a separate class has a description which is not in the vMR model.
			a.) This is because we anticipate that it will be very useful to be able to describe an entity, eg. output "NQF Measure 31"
				which is identified by its ID having an OID for the measure, but not being human readable.
	d. Specimen has a description which is not in the vMR model.
			a.) This is because we anticipate that it will be useful at some point to be able to process natural language text
				about a specimen that is important clinical information.
	e. ClinicalStatements:
		1.) bodySiteCode > optional. 
		2.) SubstanceAdministrationEvent (issues that are not fixed in schema)
			a.) doseNumber in immunization applies to one vaccine component, rather than the entire possibly combined substance
			b.) isValid in immunization applies to one vaccine component, rather than the entire possibly combined substance
			c.) unresolved: options include using related observations and making dose # and isValid part of repeating objects
				that include references back to the ID of the substance component.
4. CDSOutput seems to match perfectly
5. CDSInputSpecification seems to match perfectly.

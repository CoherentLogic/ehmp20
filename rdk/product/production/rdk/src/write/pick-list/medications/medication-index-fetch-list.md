+ Parameters

    :[site]({{{common}}}/parameters/site.md)

    + searchString: `ACD` (string, required) - A string that is the closest match to the index you want to start returning data from

    + ien: `31` (number, required) - There is differing opinions on where this IEN comes from. One source says it comes from rpc 'ORWUL FV4DG' Another source says the following: Examples:  31 = O RX, for Outpatient Meds, 32 = UD RX, for Unit Dose â€“ Inpatient Meds. There is no RPC that retrieves this IEN.  It is hardcoded in CPRS GUI code and passed as a literal string input. Use the quickViewIen 31 for Outpatient Medications.

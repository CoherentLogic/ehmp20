INPUT PARAMETER
INPUT PARAMETER:   GMVLIST
PARAMETER TYPE:   LITERAL
MAXIMUM DATA LENGTH:   60
REQUIRED:   YES
SEQUENCE NUMBER:   1
DESCRIPTION:
A list of vital type abbreviations (FILE 120.51, Field 1) separated by
up-arrows (e.g., "HT^WT" for height and weight). When the value is null,
all qualifier information will be returned for all vital types.
RETURN PARAMETER DESCRIPTION
Returns the qualifier information for the selected vital types in the
array specified. Includes the abnormal high and low values for the vital
type, if any.

The result array contains:
 RESULT(n)=piece1^piece2^piece3^piece4^piece5^piece6^piece7^piece8^piece9
 RESULT(n.nnn)=pieceA^pieceB^pieceC^pieceD

  where n is a sequential number starting with 1
        piece1 = V for vital type
        piece2 = FILE 120.51 IEN for this vital type
        piece3 = vital type name (FILE 120.51, Field .01)
        piece4 = Abbreviation (FILE 120.51, Field 1)
        piece5 = PCE Abbreviation (FILE 120.51, Field 7)
        piece6 = If vital type is Blood Pressure this is the
                 abnormal systolic high value (File 120.57, Field 5.7).
                 If vital type is Temperature, this is the abnormal high
                 value (File 120.57, Field 5.1)
                 If vital type is Respiration, this is the abnormal high
                 value (File 120.57, Field 5.5)
                 If vital type is Pulse, this is the abnormal high value
                 (File 120.57, Field 5.3)
                 If vital type is Central Venous Pressure, this is the
                 abnormal high value (File 120.57, Field 6.1)
        piece7 = If vital type is Blood Pressure this is the
                 abnormal diastolic high value (File 120.57, Field 5.71).
                 If vital type is Temperature, this is the abnormal low
                 value (File 120.57, Field 5.2)
                 If vital type is Respiration, this is the abnormal low
                 value (File 120.57, Field 5.6)
                 If vital type is Pulse, this is the abnormal low value
                 (File 120.57, Field 5.4)
                 If vital type is Central Venous Pressure, this is the
                 abnormal low value (File 120.57, Field 6.2)
        piece8 = If vital type is Blood Pressure this is the
                 abnormal systolic low value (File 120.57, Field 5.8).
                 If vital type is Central Pressure, this is the abnormal
                 O2 saturation (File 120.57, Field 6.3)
        piece9 = If vital type is Blood Pressure this is the
                 abnormal diastolic low value (File 120.57, Field 5.81).

 RESULT(n.nnn)=pieceA^pieceB^pieceC^pieceD
  where pieceA = C for CATEGORY or Q for QUALIFIER

  if pieceA is C, then
        pieceB = FILE 120.53 IEN for this category
        pieceC = category name (FILE 120.53, Field .01)
        pieceD = null

  if pieceB is Q, then
        pieceB = FILE 120.52 IEN for this qualifier
        pieceC = qualifier name (FILE 120.52, Field .01)
        pieceD = synonym (FILE 120.52, Field .02)

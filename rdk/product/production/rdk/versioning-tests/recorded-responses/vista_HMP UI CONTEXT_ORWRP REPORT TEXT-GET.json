The patient is currently\r\n              hospitalized secondary to his injuries from an IED blast. \r\n              Current Diet is NPO, and the nursing staff report that he\r\n              coughs frequently when given sips of water. A modified barium \r\n              swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's\r\n              swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.  \r\n\r\n            Report: \r\n              STUDY: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the\r\n              radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. Radiologist. The\r\n              patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair\r\n              throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's \r\n              swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated\r\n              amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of\r\n              thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid\r\n              (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3);\r\n              solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  FINDINGS ORAL STAGE: The\r\n              patient had no spillage out lips. Oral residual after swallow\r\n              with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear\r\n              oral cavity.  The patient has reduced lingual retraction\r\n              contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow. Trace\r\n              premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this\r\n              assessment.  PHARYNGEAL STAGE: Aspiration noted on cup sips of \r\n              thin liquid. Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of\r\n              thin liquid during and after the swallow. The penetration after\r\n              the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform\r\n              sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has\r\n              incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and\r\n              penetration with thin liquids. The patient had no aspiration or \r\n              penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid\r\n              food. The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation\r\n              and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic\r\n              inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.\r\n              Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow\r\n              with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the\r\n              solid feed presentation. The patient has mild residual of\r\n              pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear\r\n              with sequential swallows.  CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The\r\n              patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well \r\n              coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.  \r\n\r\n            Impression: \r\n              DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin\r\n              liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon\r\n              amounts of thin liquid. No aspiration or penetration occurred\r\n              with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this\r\n              assessment.  PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: With a modified diet, the\r\n              patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.  \r\n\r\n            DX Codes: \r\n              MINOR ABNORMALITY\r\n\r\n01/29/2015  CT HEAD W&WO CONT\r\n            CPT Code:    70470\r\n            Interpreting Staff:  IMAGER,IMAGERONE\r\n            Interpreting Res.:   PROVIDER,TWOHUNDRE\r\n            Exam Case Number:    5\r\n            Exam Status:         COMPLETE\r\n            Rpt Status:  VERIFIED             Technologist: LABTECH,FIFTYNINE\r\n\r\n            Reason for Study: \r\n              TBI \r\n\r\n            History: \r\n              CAR ACCIDENT \r\n\r\n            Additional History: \r\n              UNRESTRAINED DRIVER, HEADHIT GLASS \r\n\r\n            Report: \r\n              NO PREVIOUS CT TO COMPARE WITH, SWELLING NOTED FRONTAL LOBES,\r\n              NO BLOOD SEEN, NO ARTERIAL LEAKGE NOTED.

Scalp was clipped. He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen \r\n  with ChloraPrep. Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with \r\n  epinephrine 1:200,000. He received oxacillin.\r\n   \r\n  He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.\r\n   \r\n  The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve. Subcutaneous \r\n  sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts. I \r\n  separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium \r\n  pressure small contour Medtronic valve. There was some flow from the \r\n  ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect. I removed the right-\r\n  angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and \r\n  there was gushing of CSF under high pressure. So, I do believe that the \r\n  catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did \r\n  not show any specific obstructions. A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed \r\n  through the same hole. I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure \r\n  it was in the cavity. It entered easily and there was still just intermittent \r\n  flow of CSF. The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.\r\n   \r\n  I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there \r\n  was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter. So I did not think \r\n  it was necessary to replace those at this time. The new catheter was trimmed \r\n  to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve. The \r\n  valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture. \r\n  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation. The shunt pumped and \r\n  refilled well. The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal \r\n  suture and Steri-Strips on the skin. It was uncertain whether this will \r\n  correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate. If his abdominal \r\n  pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve. This will be \r\n  determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill \r\n  easily. The patient tolerated the procedure well. No complications. Sponge \r\n  and needle counts were correct. Blood loss was minimal. None replaced.\r\n   \r\n  /es/ ONE SURGEON\r\n  \r\n  Signed: 02/04/2015 12:41\r\n   \r\n  /es/ Two Surgeon, MD\r\n  Orthopedic Surgery Staff\r\n  Cosigned: 02/04/2015 16:04\r\n12/08/2006           General(OR when not       Surgeon: PROVIDER,ONE\r\n                       Defined below)\r\n             Status: (Completed)            Prin Anest: PROVIDER,THREE\r\n     Pre-op Diag(s): Left Inguinal Hernia (Unverified)\r\n    Post-op Diag(s): Left Inguinal Hernia (Unverified)\r\n  Operative Proc(s): LEFT INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR\r\n           Lab Work: Yes\r\n  \r\n   LOCAL TITLE: OPERATION REPORT                                   \r\n  DATE OF NOTE: DEC 08, 2006@07:30     ENTRY DATE: DEC 08, 2006@14:06:13      \r\n       SURGEON: PROVIDER,ONE            ATTENDING: TDPROVIDER,ONE               \r\n       URGENCY:                            STATUS: COMPLETED                     \r\n       SUBJECT: Case #: 10014                                                    \r\n  \r\n  SURGEON:                PROVIDER,ONE \r\n   \r\n   1ST ASST:               PROVIDER,TWO \r\n   \r\n   ATTENDING:              TDPROVIDER,ONE \r\n   \r\n   PROCEDURE:            LEFT INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR WITH MESH\r\n   \r\n   HISTORY:  Essentially patient  underwent  preop evaluation  for  left \r\n   inguinal mass  noted  since  September 2004.    Recently  PT became  more \r\n   symptomatic with  increased size and  tenderness.  Patient  denied any history\r\n   of melena or bloody stools.   Denied a history of constipation or diarrhea. \r\n   No recent fevers or chills.   He was admitted on December 7, 2006,\r\n   for an elective left inguinal hernia repair. \r\n   \r\n   SUMMARY OF PROCEDURES:   After  consent was  obtained,  the  patient was \r\n   prepped and  draped in  sterile fashion.   Lidocaine  1% was  used to \r\n   anesthetize the  skin and a 5-cm incision was made in the left groin.  \r\n   The skin and subcu was dissected down to the  external oblique fascia.  \r\n   The fascia was incised to the external ring and the spermatic cord and\r\n   all its contents were isolated  with a Penrose drain.  The  hernia sac\r\n   was  then dissected and reduced into the large direct inguinal defect.  \r\n   Three large  mesh plugs  were secured  together and  used to  plug the\r\n   direct  defect  and  secured  in place  with  2  interrupted  Prolene\r\n   stitches.   An onlay patch was  then applied and secured  to the pubic\r\n   tubercle  and secured to the fascial edges using a running 2-0 Prolene\r\n   suture on  either side.  The external oblique was then closed over the\r\n   repair, being cognizant  of the ilioinguinal  nerve.  All superficial\r\n   bleeding was  controlled with electrocautery.   Copious irrigation was\r\n   used  and additional 1% Lidocaine  was used to  anesthetize the subcu and\r\n   fascia.  Scarpa  fascia was closed  using 4-0 Vicryl.   Additional 4-0  \r\n   Vicryl was  used in  a subcuticular  fashion  to close  the skin.  \r\n   Steri-Strips were applied and dressings.   The patient  was extubated and\r\n   stable to recovery, tolerated the procedure well.   The attending\r\n   physician, TDPROVDIER,ONE, was scrubbed during the entire case.\r\n   \r\n  /es/ ONE PROVIDER\r\n  MD\r\n  Signed: 12/08/2006 18:19\r\n   \r\n  /es/ ONE TDPROVIDER\r\n  MD\r\n  Cosigned: 12/11/2006 08:45\r\n\r\n----------------------------- PN - Progress Notes -----------------------------\r\n08/14/2015 13:16  Local Title: ADVANCE DIRECTIVE\r\n               Standard Title: \r\n\r\nNote originating from Panorama\r\n\r\n\r\n               Signed by:  /es/  ONE VEHU\r\n                           08/14/2015 13:17\r\n\r\n09/10/2013 10:12  Local Title: PRIMARY CARE TRIAGE NOTE\r\n               Standard Title: PRIMARY CARE TRIAGE NOTE\r\n\r\nFLU SHOT TEST NOTE FOR FILING DSS ID.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Signed by:  /es/  ONE PROGRAMMER\r\n                           09/10/2013 10:15\r\n\r\n05/16/2007 09:50  Local Title: ADVANCE DIRECTIVE COMPLETED\r\n               Standard Title: ADVANCE DIRECTIVE\r\n\r\n   VistA Imaging - Scanned Document\r\n\r\n\r\n               Signed by:  /es/  FIFTYNINE LABTECH\r\n                           05/16/2007 09:50\r\n\r\n04/01/2004 22:57  Local Title: AUDIOLOGY - HEARING LOSS CONSULT\r\n               Standard Title: \r\n                    AUTHOR:  PATHOLOGY,ONE\r\n\r\nHX:  Patient was seen for hearing aid fitting and orientation.\r\nThe batteries supplied for this hearing aid were: za312.\r\n \r\nIMP:   The veteran was seen for hearing aid fitting and orientation.

This is similar to episodes that he's had \r\nin the past when he's had low blood sugar. His wife had difficulty \r\ngetting him up out of bed due to leg weakness and discoordination. She \r\ngave him some orange juice and brought him into the ER for evaluation. \r\nHe reports that over the past few days he has noted increased leg \r\nswelling, facial puffiness, and increased SOB. He has noted some PND and \r\northopnea. He has had some vague chest discomfort this morning, left \r\nanterior chest, which is now resolved. Otherwise, he reports that he's \r\nbeen doing reasonably well without episodes of hypoglycemia. He's not \r\nbeen experiencing chest pain. He generally eats no added salt diet. He's \r\nbeen taking his medications as prescribed, however, his wife questions \r\nthis at times. \r\n \r\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: \r\n\r\nActive Inpatient and Outpatient Medications (including Supplies): \r\n\r\n     Outpatient Medications                                 Status \r\n========================================================================= \r\n1)   SIMVASTATIN 40MG TAB TAKE ONE TABLET BY BY MOUTH       ACTIVE \r\n       EVERY EVENING \r\n\r\nALLERGIES: Penicillins. \r\n \r\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Timbuktu with his spouse of many \r\nyears.

(this was up about 7 pounds since last seen in the clinic two weeks \r\nago). In general the patient appears an ill, weak, elderly appearing \r\nmale in no acute distress. He is oriented and is able to give a good \r\nhistory. \r\n \r\nSkin: Somewhat clammy without notable rash. \r\n \r\nHEENT: Eyes: Sclerae anicteric. Oropharynx with moist mucous membranes. \r\n \r\nNeck: Supple without palpable mass or adenopathy. \r\n \r\nLungs: Diminished throughout, particularly diminished in the bases \r\nbilaterally. There is dullness to percussion in both bases. I hear faint \r\nbasilar rales, not prominent. \r\n \r\nHeart: Distant, regular rate and rhythm with a 2 out of 6 systolic \r\nmurmur heard loudest at the left upper sternal border. S1 is normal. S2 \r\nhas a fixed split. I do not hear and S3 gallop. PMI is nondisplaced. \r\n \r\nAbdomen: Nondistended with active bowel sounds. No focal mass or \r\ntenderness.

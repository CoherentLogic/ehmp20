Feature: F119 As a consumer of the search service, I need to see suggestions after 3 letters typed by the user (Same as HMP service)

Background:
      #Given a patient with pid "10110V004877" has been synced through the RDK API
      Given a patient with pid "9E7A;3" has been synced through the RDK API
      


@F119_1_searchsuggestion @VPR 
Scenario Outline: When a user searches patient's medication by text search total number of records are returned.
#Given a patient with "this medication exists" in multiple VistAs
When the user types three letters of "<text>" for the patient "9E7A;3" in VPR format
Then the corresponding total suggested items are "<total_items>"

      | text                            | total_items |

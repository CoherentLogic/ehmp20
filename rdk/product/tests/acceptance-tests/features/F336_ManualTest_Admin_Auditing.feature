Feature: F336 -  Admin Auditing Console

#US4692
@manual
Scenario: Manually check that accessed records are flagged as sensitive for certain sites - ensure sensitivity and site code are in each audit entry
    Given a user is logged into EHMP-UI and searches for patient Threehundredeighty,Patient, who has a patient ID of 100379
    Then to manually confirm the entry is there ssh vagrant@IP_ADDRESS
    And the password is vagrant
    Then cd /tmp
    Then tail audit.log
    Then confirm that last entry was on the time of the patient search and that the patient ID in the log is 100379

#US4694
@manual
Scenario: Manually check that special accounts are denoted with XUPROG and/or XUPROGMODE keys
    Given a user is logged into EHMP-UI as NURSE,EIGHT (access code nur1234, verify code nur1234!!) and searches for patient Threehundredeighty,Patient, who has a patient ID of 100379
    Then to manually confirm the a GET request entry is there and that the keys are present by doing ssh vagrant@IP_ADDRESS
    And the password is vagrant
    Then cd /tmp
    Then tail audit.log
    Then confirm that last entry has an additionalMessages field with XUPROG and/or XUPROGMODE keys

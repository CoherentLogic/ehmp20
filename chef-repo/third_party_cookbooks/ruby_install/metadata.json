{"name":"ruby_install","version":"1.0.5","description":"Installs/Configures ruby-install","long_description":"ruby-install Chef Cookbook\n==========================\n\nInstalls [ruby-install][ruby-install], a simple way to build Rubies and\nthe natural companion to [chruby][chruby].\n\n[ruby-install][ruby-install] itself is responsible for getting and\ndependencies necessary for building a particular Ruby.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nCookbooks\n---------\n\nThe following cookbook is a direct dependency because it is used for\ncommon \"default\" functionality.\n\n* ark\n\nOn RHEL family distros, the \"yum\" cookbook is required for obtaining\nlatest dependencies for building Rubies.\n\nOn Debian family distros, the \"apt\" cookbooks is required for obtaining\nlatest dependencies for building Rubies.\n\nPlatform\n--------\n\nThe following platforms are supported and tested under test kitchen.\n\n* Ubuntu 14.10\n* Debian 7.8\n* CentOS 7.1\n* Fedora 21\n\nOther Debian and RHEL family distributions are assumed to work.  Other\ndistributions that [ruby-install][ruby-install] supports should also\nwork, please [report][issues] any additional platforms so they can be\nadded.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nSimply include `recipe[ruby_install]` in your run_list to have\nruby-install installed.  You will also have access to the\n`ruby_install_ruby` resource.\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\ndefault\n-------\n\nInstalls the ruby-install codebase and initializes Chef to use the\nLightweight Resources and Providers ([LWRPs][lwrp]).\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nversion\n-------\n\nThe version of ruby-install that will be installed.\n\nThe default is the current latest version 0.4.1\n\nchecksum\n--------\n\nsha256 checksum of the version to be installed, used for security.\n\nThe default is a checksum that matches up with the latest ruby-install.\n\ndefault_ruby_base_path\n----------------------\n\nThe default base path for installed Rubies.  For example the following\nresource:\n\n    ruby_install_ruby 'ruby 2.0.0-p247'\n\nwill be installed into \n`\"#{node['ruby_install']['default_ruby_base_path']}/ruby-2.0.0-p247\"`\n\nThe default is `\"/opt/rubies\"`.\n\nIf you are using ruby-install alongside [chruby][chruby] it expects, by\ndefault, to find Rubies in `/opt/rubies` or `~/.rubies`.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\n### Contributing\n\nPull requests are very welcome! Ideally create a topic branch for every\nseparate change you make.\n\nThis cookbook uses [ChefSpec][chefspec] for unit tests. I also use [Food\nCritic][foodcritic] and [RuboCop][rubocop] to check for style issues.\nWhen contributing it would be very helpful if you could run these via\n`bundle exec spec` and `bundle exec style`.\n\nLastly, there are [Serverspec][serverspec] integration tests for use\nwith [Test Kitchen][testkitchen]. At the very least the installation\nintegration tests should be run, you can ignore the EC2 one if you don't\nhave an AWS account (which you will get billed for). The allrubies tests\noften fail due to a particular Ruby failing to build on an OS, this is\nnot necessarily an issue with this cookbook though so can safely be\nignored. To see all of the available integration test suites just check\n`bundle exec rake T` or `bundle exec kitchen list`\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: [Ross Timson][rosstimson] (<ross@rosstimson.com>)\n\nHeavily influenced by, and some code from the [Ruby-Build\ncookbook][chef-ruby_build], Author:: [Fletcher Nichol][fnichol] (<fnichol@nichol.ca>)\n\nCopyright 2013-2014, Ross Timson\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n\n[rosstimson]:         https://github.com/rosstimson\n[fnichol]:            https://github.com/fnichol\n[repo]:               https://github.com/rosstimson/chef-ruby_install\n[issues]:             https://github.com/rosstimson/chef-ruby_install/issues\n[chef-ruby_build]:    https://github.com/fnichol/chef-ruby_build\n[ruby-install]:       https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install\n[chruby]:             https://github.com/postmodern/chruby\n[lwrp]:               http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Lightweight+Resources+and+Providers+%28LWRP%29\n[chefsepc]:           https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec\n[foodcritic]:         https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic\n[rubocop]:            https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop\n[serverspec]:         https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec\n[testkitchen]:        https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen\n","maintainer":"Ross Timson","maintainer_email":"ross@rosstimson.com","license":"Apache v2.0","platforms":{"centos":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"ark":">= 0.0.0","apt":">= 0.0.0","yum":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{"ruby_install/default_ruby_base_path":{"display_name":"Default Ruby base path","description":"Location where Rubies should be installed","default":"/opt/rubies"}},"groupings":{},"recipes":{}}

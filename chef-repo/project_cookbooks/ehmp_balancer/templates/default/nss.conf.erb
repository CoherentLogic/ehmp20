# This is the Apache server configuration file providing SSL support using.
# the mod_nss plugin.  It contains the configuration directives to instruct
# the server how to serve pages over an https connection.

# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.

# When we also provide SSL we have to listen to the 
# standard HTTP port (see above) and to the HTTPS port
#
# Note: Configurations that use IPv6 but not IPv4-mapped addresses need two
#       Listen directives: "Listen [::]:8443" and "Listen 0.0.0.0:443"

##  SSL Global Context
##
##  All SSL configuration in this context applies both to
##  the main server and all SSL-enabled virtual hosts.

#   Pass Phrase Dialog:
#   Configure the pass phrase gathering process.
#   The filtering dialog program (`builtin' is a internal
#   terminal dialog) has to provide the pass phrase on stdout.

#   Configure the SSL Session Cache. 
#   NSSSessionCacheSize is the number of entries in the cache.
#   NSSSessionCacheTimeout is the SSL2 session timeout (in seconds).
#   NSSSession3CacheTimeout is the SSL3/TLS session timeout (in seconds).

# Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG):
# Configure one or more sources to seed the PRNG of the SSL library.
# The seed data should be of good random quality.
# WARNING! On some platforms /dev/random blocks if not enough entropy
# is available. Those platforms usually also provide a non-blocking
# device, /dev/urandom, which may be used instead.
#
# This does not support seeding the RNG with each connection.

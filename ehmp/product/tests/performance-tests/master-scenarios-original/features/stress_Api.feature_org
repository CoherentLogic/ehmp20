And given the patient has data accross 4 VistA instances 
And the data has not been synched
When the number of requests is increased by increments of 10,000
Then the system is at maximum stress
And capture the response time for each request to complete

@future
Scenario: Document data store almost full

And given the patient has data accross 4 VistA instances 
And the data has not been synched
And when additional requests are sent

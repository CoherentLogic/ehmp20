Scenario: Client can request immunization in VPR format
	Given a patient with "immunization" in multiple VistAs
      Given a patient with pid "9E7A;6" has been synced through Admin API
	When the client requests immunization for the patient "9E7A;6" in VPR format
	Then the client receives 1 VPR "VistA" result(s)
	Then the client receives 1 VPR "panorama" result(s)
	And the VPR results contain:

# negative test case for immunization.  .

@f100_5_immunization_neg_vpr	
Scenario: Negative scenario.  Client can request immunization results in VPR format
Given a patient with "No immunization results" in multiple VistAs
Given a patient with pid "9E7A;1" has been synced through Admin API
When the client requests immunization for the patient "9E7A;1" in VPR format
Then a successful response is returned
Then corresponding matching records totaling "0" are displayed

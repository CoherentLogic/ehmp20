rbVista, version 1.0 beta, is a Ruby version of the MDO version of the
Delphi RPC Broker. It offers basic RPC connectivity to a single VistA
system. Unlike MDO, it has no multi-site functionality, nor can it
visit Vista systems. There must be a logged in user. It can connect,
login, set context, make RPCs and disconnect. It should theoretically
be able to make any RPC. See tests for how it works.
